                <h1>Weather apps can be overwhelming, confusing, and time consuming</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Current weather apps present a great amount of data. Users are left to dechipher conditions for themselves which can leave them feeling less that certain. With safety and enjoyment on the line, this causes frustration and wastes time since it is a repeated process.</p>
                <h5>How can a weather app save time and keep the experience of planning an outing on the water enjoyable?</h5>

                <h1>Give them what they want</h1>
                <br>
                <p>An app that address <strong>real question</strong> users are asking. It's not what the weather will be, it's <strong>"When can I do my thing?"</strong> There should be no need to brush up on highschool science class to know the best times to hit the water (although it can't hurt).</p>

                        <li>They're not checking the weather, they're checking if they can do their activity</li>
                        <li>Information shown should be <strong>tailored to the activity</strong></li>
                        <li>Users don't want to scan through numbers</li>

                <h3>Inspiration from stock trading apps</h3>
                <p>It was discovered in user interviews that graphic elements were preferred over tables and text</p>
                <p>Stock traders use graphic elements to display information and time their trades. I thought that a similar approach could translate well to picking out weather data.</p>
                <p>Issues - why it didn't work: After spending some time building up this concept, I took a step back and realized this was not achieving the original goal of knowing future weather conditions as quickly as possible. There was still too much effort necessary from the user, so this idea was scrapped.</p>

                <h3>Changing from "financed inspired" to simply "best times"</h3>
                <p>The finance chart-inspired graphics were a good start in exploring ways to convey a lot of information on one screen. However, the utility of it did not fit the purpose here.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the simplest idea is best. It seems obvious now, but just displaying the best times based on user criteria is simple, quick, and effective.</p>

                <h3>Distingishing between "alerts" and "notification"</h3>
                <p>Alerts and notifications were both originally in the design</p>
                <p>It was unanimous in user testing that having both was confusing so one had to go.</p>
                <p>Since users already provide criteria for ideal conditions, it seemed redundant to have alerts, so they were nixed.</p>

                <h3>Include details to identify graphics</h3>
                <p>The goal was to create very simple graphics for users to easily interpret</p>
                <p>Initial iterations were too simple, users asked for icons to help give meaning to the graphics</p>
                <p>Ex. Small sun and moon icons were added to the high level information on the dashboard.</p>

            <!--Learnings-->

            <div> 
                <h5>LEARNINGS / FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h5>
                <p><strong>Every process, and each mistake within that process, provides opportunities to learn. Here I've captured my top learnings as well as improvements I'd make in the future.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't get stuck on the details too soon - The earlier you fail the better. It's best to come up with as many ideas as you can in the beginning of the design phase without getting attached to one too soon. I noticed I put too much effort into my first idea only to realize that I could come up with a better solution and all that extra work wasn't necessary. Moving forward I can catch myself before falling trap to this.</li>
                    <li>Never underestimate user interviews - I realized that user interviews, surveys, etc., are the foundation for any UX project. If it weren't for them then everything would have to be made up. You never know what key information you can pull from an interview so make sure you prepare for them well, but all also be willing to let the conversations flow naturally.</li>
                    <li>Always go back to the original problem - It can be easy to get distracted by new ideas while designing and lose focus of the main idea. I've found it helpful to routinely go back and check that the current solution still solves the original problem and hasn't lost its focus.</li>
                    <li>Include more educational info in the app- As the app stands now, it is up to the user to define the weather criteria that fits them best. I would want to add some type of educational criteria that guides users to choosing the best times if they are unsure. There could be bite-size snippets of information that pop up about why the weather is acting a certain way. Over time this will help users understand the conditions better.</li>
